Guide and Navigation of a mobile robot

### Build Status

Program in .m (Matlab) to simulate the guide and navigation of a mobile robot. The main program is "Planificador.m", which generates a trajectory between the actual position of the robot and the objective. The localization is made through the Kalman Filter. The robot is a Pioneer 3T, with three SONARs.

For more information, read the report (.pdf), where everything is explained.
